    The "Geographical Structural Analysis of Vienna" is not based on a separate mapping, but is an aggregation of the "City Mapping of Vienna 1955-1958".
    The information was transferred from the data originally collected at building level to the building block level.

    However, the spatial consolidation of the original map series is accompanied by greater functional differentiation.
    The main categories remained the same, but became more differentiated, as can be seen in the very extensive
    legend of the map:

    In the map the category "Terraced housing development in the
    urban area", not only the construction period and the building type, but also the degree of development    
    (building density) and the building height was considered. Likewise, the typology "Building on the outskirts of the city" of 14    
    categories (in the urban mapping) to 40 categories; in particular in the categories "Unplanned suburban settlements" and the    
    suburban housing estates" and the allotment gardens ("Transitions from allotment gardens to housing estates after the 1st World War").
    Even if corresponding documentation is not available, it can be considered probable    
    that additional surveys were carried out.

    The map series at a scale of 1:10,000 is kept in the archives of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and consists of 21 map sheets. As with the "Stadtkartierung Wien", the area signatures were hand-colored or created using handwritten area signatures.
