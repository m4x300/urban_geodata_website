    The Gründerzeit building fabric in Vienna in the 1970s and 1980s was characterized by increasing signs of decay 
    which can be attributed to the lack of private investment in conservation for decades. For this 
    For this reason, in 1974 Vienna launched the program of gentle urban renewal, which, through public    
    public subsidies to encourage homeowners to maintain or upgrade the building fabric.

    Against this background, between 1982 and 1989 Elisabeth Lichtenberger, together with students from the Institute of 
    Geography and Regional Research (then the Institute of Geography) at the University of Vienna carried out a comprehensive survey of the    
    structural condition of the Viennese Gründerzeit. The delimitation of the survey area (see below)    
    was based on the city atlas of Vienna from 1955 - 1965, which was also developed at the Institute of Geography.    
    was also developed at the Institute of Geography. The mapping of the building stock was carried out at the level of individual buildings, whereby the survey was    
    the survey was organized at the level of the census districts. The mapping covers 90 of the total of 250 Vienna    
    census districts. The census districts and their survey year are also stored in the vectorization.

    In order to adequately capture the phenomenon of urban decay and urban renewal at the level of individual residential buildings, a very simple typology was developed.
    This was also necessary in order not to prolong the survey too much and to ensure the comparability of the spatial units.
    The survey categories are described by Elisabeth
    Lichtenberger (1990) describes the survey categories as a "polarized building condition model", in which firstly the gradual forms of urban decay
    (five categories), secondly the renewal of the building stock (two categories) and thirdly the good building fabric (two categories).

    The surveys carried out by the students were collected in street lists and transferred in two steps, first to a city
    map (scale 1:2000) and later transferred to the map at a scale of 1:10,000. This final product forms the basis    
    for the vectorization in the urban_geodata project.     
    This map series covers the structural condition of 28,384 residential buildings from the 1980s. That decade before    
    the fall of the Iron Curtain, in which Vienna was characterized by stagnation, which was clearly reflected not only in the    
    demographic development, but also in the Gründerzeit housing market.   
    The value of this historical map work for today's research results from the fact that the structural condition of the Gründerzeit city    
    has been recorded with a high level of detail during an interesting urban development period
