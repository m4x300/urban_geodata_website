    In the first years after the fall of communism, an assessment of the structural condition of the existing city was carried out in Budapest.
    The survey was made between October 1993 and January 1994 under the scientific direction of Elisabeth Lichtenberger. 
    The survey of the structural condition was carried out in three stages:

    Similar to the mapping in Vienna, the boundaries of the study area were based on the redevelopment areas defined by the city.
    redevelopment areas defined by the city; in Budapest, a survey of the "urban renewal area" was carried out, which includes parts of districts 5 to 9.

    The survey categories were also based on the simple typology used in Vienna: urban decay (5 categories), urban renewal (3 categories) and old buildings in order (2 categories).

    Conversely, unlike in Vienna, vacancy did not play a particularly large role in Budapest's city.
    The results of the structural condition survey were compiled in a map at a scale of 1:10,000. 
    The analogue map, which was vectorized as part of this project, comprises a total of 7114 buildings.
